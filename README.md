# MultiheartHelper
Adds multiple heart support for Celeste maps

Also adds some entities I needed:
- Moving dust wall: like a lava/frost wall but it's made of dust and grows
- Named Theo crystal: If a room is entered while holding (or throwable freezing) a theo crystal of the same name as one present in the room, the one in the room will not spawn
- Semipermanent crumble block: Will stay crumbled until death, does not reset on room transitions
